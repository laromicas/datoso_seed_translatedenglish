# Datoso Seed Translated English

Datoso is a WIP Python command line tool to download and organize your Dat Roms.
As today the tool supports dat-omatic, redump, and translated-english dats.
It merges all the dats in a tree folder structure thought to use with Emulators rather than dats.
The dat file format must be compatible with [ROMVault](https://www.romvault.com/).

Translated-English is a collection of DATs aimed for video game translations.

## Installation

Datoso requires python 3.10+.

Use pip (recommended to use a virtual environment):
If you only need this plugin you can install it directly

``` bash
pip install datoso_seed_translatedenglish

```

## Usage
